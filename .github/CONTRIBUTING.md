## Code of Conduct

This project follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors. By participating, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- HandBrake CLI installed on your system
- Git

### Quick Setup

1. **Fork and Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handbrake-mcp.git
   cd handbrake-mcp
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -e ".[dev]"

   # Install HandBrake CLI (see Installation docs)
   ```

3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_tests.py unit
   ```

## Development Setup

### Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:
- `feature/description-of-feature`
- `bugfix/issue-description`
- `docs/update-documentation`
- `refactor/component-name`

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-batch-processing
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Testing related changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add batch video processing support

fix: resolve memory leak in transcoding job

docs: update installation instructions for Windows
```

### Code Style

This project uses:
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

All code must pass these checks before being merged.

## Testing

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test real HandBrake CLI integration
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
python scripts/run_tests.py unit

# Run integration tests (requires HandBrake CLI)
python scripts/run_tests.py integration

# Run all tests
python scripts/run_tests.py all

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_handbrake.py -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Use `pytest` framework
- Place test files in `tests/` directory
- Name test files as `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test function names
- Include docstrings for complex tests

Example:
```python
def test_transcode_success(unit_test_setup):
    """Test successful video transcoding."""
    setup = unit_test_setup

    job_id = await setup['service'].transcode(
        input_path=str(setup['input_file']),
        output_path=str(setup['output_file']),
        preset="Fast 1080p30",
    )

    assert job_id is not None
    # ... more assertions
```
