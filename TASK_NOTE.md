# HandBrake MCP Server - Task Note

## Project Overview

Create a Model Control Protocol (MCP) server for HandBrake video transcoding to integrate with the existing media toolchain. This server will handle video compression and format conversion as part of an automated media processing pipeline.

## Purpose

- Bridge the gap between qbtmcp (download) and plexmcp (upload) in the media workflow
- Provide programmatic control over HandBrake video transcoding
- Enable automated processing of downloaded media files

## Key Features

1. Video transcoding with customizable presets
2. Batch processing capabilities
3. Hardware acceleration support
4. Progress tracking and notifications
5. Integration with existing MCP ecosystem

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+
- FastMCP 2.10+
- HandBrakeCLI
- Watchdog (for file system monitoring)
- FastAPI (for web interface)

## Initial Considerations

- Need to handle various video codecs and containers
- Should support both interactive and automated workflows
- Must include proper error handling and logging
- Should be resource-efficient for server environments
