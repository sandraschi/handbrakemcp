# HandBrake MCP Server - Status Update (2025-07-27)

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- Created initial project structure with proper Python packaging
- Set up `pyproject.toml` with all required dependencies
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` and `.env.example` files
- Created detailed `README.md` with setup instructions

### 2. Core Implementation
- Implemented configuration management with environment variables
- Created base FastAPI application with FastMCP 2.10 integration
- Set up logging and CORS middleware
- Added health check endpoint

### 3. HandBrake Service
- Implemented `HandBrakeService` class for video transcoding
- Added job management with progress tracking
- Implemented support for HandBrake presets
- Added error handling and job cancellation

### 4. MCP Tools
- Implemented core MCP tools:
  - `transcode_video`: Transcode a single video file
  - `batch_transcode`: Process multiple video files
  - `get_presets`: List available HandBrake presets
  - `get_job_status`: Check status of a transcoding job
  - `cancel_job`: Stop an ongoing transcoding job
  - `get_loaded_models`: List available presets (MCP compatibility)
  - `get_provider_status`: Check HandBrake service status

## üöß Current Work in Progress

### 1. API Endpoints
- Implementing REST API endpoints for transcoding operations
- Adding WebSocket support for real-time progress updates
- Implementing request/response models with proper validation

### 2. Watch Folder Support
- Adding file system monitoring for automatic processing
- Implementing file event handling
- Adding support for processed file management

### 3. Notification System
- Implementing webhook notifications for job events
- Adding email notification support
- Creating event-based notification system

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Complete API Implementation**
   - Finish REST API endpoints
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Add request validation and error handling

2. **Watch Folder Implementation**
   - Add file system monitoring
   - Implement file event handling
   - Add configuration for watch folders

3. **Notification System**
   - Implement webhook notifications
   - Add email notification support
   - Create notification templates

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for core functionality
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Test with various video formats and presets

5. **DXT Packaging**
   - Create `manifest.json` for DXT
   - Implement DXT packaging script
   - Test DXT package installation and operation

## üîç Technical Notes

- The project is being developed with Python 3.8+ compatibility
- Using FastAPI for the web server and FastMCP 2.10 for MCP compliance
- HandBrakeCLI is required for video transcoding
- Configuration is managed through environment variables with sensible defaults

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- WebSocket implementation for real-time progress updates is pending
- Watch folder functionality needs to be implemented
- Notification system is not yet complete
- Additional testing is required for various video formats and edge cases
